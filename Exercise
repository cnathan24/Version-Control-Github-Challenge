The terminal is a way to send simple text commands to the computer as well 
as navigate through files & folders.


The main difference between Git and Github, is that Git is just a version
control system that enables the user to manage and keep track of their 
source code history. On the other hand, Github is a cloud-based hosting 
system that enables one to manage their git repositories.


We use github, because it enables multiple people to work on a project
together, working on files and merging changes at the same time. 
Also, it's a great way for others to look at your code/solo projects.
